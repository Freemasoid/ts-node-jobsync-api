Conversion is done, however I will not use it for existing project.

to run a server use `npx tsx ./src/app.ts`

To explain further why i will not use this version of API for the WebApp I already have is that i don't like how vanilla Typescript works with Node.js.
I have looked into Nest.js framework and if I am to use backend with typescript, I'd go with Nest.js.

For now I will just stick with typescript on front-end and use vanilla JS or Go on backend for future projects.
